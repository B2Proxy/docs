In scenarios such as cross-border e-commerce, social media operations, ad verification, and data collection, the combination of \*\*"\*\*anti-detect browser + residential proxy" has become the golden standard for secure multi-account management. [**B2Proxy Global Residential Proxy**](https://www.b2proxy.com) provides clean, authentic residential IPs that effectively bypass platform risk controls, while anti-detect browsers create isolated and stable browser environments for each account. Integrating the two maximizes your business anonymity and success rate.

This article outlines the integration principles and general steps, and provides direct configuration guides for mainstream anti-detect browsers.

#### **I. Core Integration Principle**

The integration process essentially involves configuring a residential proxy IP from B2Proxy for each independent browser profile created in the anti-detect browser. This ensures that traffic from each account is routed through a real, unique residential IP address, simulating the browsing behavior of genuine users from different regions worldwide.

#### ****II. General Integration Steps (Using Most Anti-detectBrowsers as an Example)****

Regardless of which anti-detect browser you use, the process of configuring B2Proxy is highly similar. Simply prepare the following information:

1. **Obtain B2Proxy Proxy Connection Information:**\
   Log in to your B2Proxy dashboard and find the following key details in your purchased residential proxy product:
   - **Proxy Type:** Typically **HTTP** or **SOCKS5**.
   - **Proxy Host (Host/IP):** The proxy host address provided by B2Proxy.
   - **Proxy Port (Port):** The corresponding connection port.
   - **Username & Password:** Your authentication credentials (not required if your proxy uses IP whitelisting).
2. **Create a New Profile in the Anti-detect Browser:**\
   Create a new browser profile and configure anti-detect parameters such as timezone, language, and User-Agent according to your business needs.
3. **Configure Proxy Settings:**
   - Locate the "Network Proxy" or "Proxy" settings module within the profile settings.
   - Select the proxy type (matching the type chosen in Step 1) and enter the **host, port, username, and password** obtained from B2Proxy.
4. **Verify IP Connection:**
   - Test the proxy connectivity, then save the configuration and launch the browser profile.
   - Visit IP check websites such as `ip2location.com` or `whatismyipaddress.com` to confirm that the displayed IP address and geographic location match the B2Proxy proxy information.
