IP whitelisting is a security authentication method provided by B2Proxy, which effectively prevents unauthorized access by allowing only authorized IP addresses to connect to the proxy service.

When using B2Proxy's API to extract proxies, you only need to add the IP addresses (local or server) from which you intend to use the proxies in the dashboard to complete the whitelist configuration. Once configured, only IPs within the whitelist can successfully extract and use the proxies.

This tutorial will guide you through adding and managing whitelisted IPs, helping you use the proxy service quickly and securely.

## I. Add Whitelisted IPs

1. Log in → Go to 「Whitelist」 section.
2. Click 「Add Whitelist」. Enter:

- IP Address (Required): IPv4 format only (e.g., 123.123.123.123).
- Notes (Optional): Label the purpose (e.g., "Finance Dept Server").

3. Click 「Confirm」.

<Warning>
  Important: Only whitelist your private IPs (e.g., office/home networks). Do not add public server IPs (security risk).
</Warning>

## II. Edit Whitelist

1. Single IP: Click 「Notes」 → Edit → Submit.
2. Bulk Edit: Select multiple IPs → Click 「Batch Remarks」 → Update.
