The sub-user feature allows the main account to allocate proxy resources (traffic) to team members and control their usage permissions, making it ideal for enterprise or team collaboration.

B2Proxy's **Sub-user Feature** enables the main account to flexibly distribute proxy resources to team members while managing their access rights. Through sub-users, you can set individual traffic limits for each member, monitor their usage, and adjust resource allocations as needed.

This article will explain how to create and manage sub-users, as well as how to assign traffic and permissions to them.

## I. Create Sub-User

1. Log in as main account → Navigate to 「Sub-Users」.
2. Click 「Add Sub-User」.

- Remark (Optional): Label purpose.
