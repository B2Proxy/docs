B2Proxy supports the quick extraction and use of unlimited residential proxies via the **username/password (credential) method**. The setup is simple and requires no additional configuration. This article will guide you on how to obtain unlimited residential proxies using the credential-based extraction method, helping you get started quickly.

## I. Basic Setup Steps

### 1. Set Session Type

Rotating IP: Auto-rotates IP per request (ideal for scraping/data collection).

Sticky IP: The IP remains fixed for a period of time (5 minutes by default), suits account management).

### 2. Bind Sub-User (Required)

Select an existing sub-user or create one to assign proxy permissions.

### 3. Select Hostname

Based on your network IP, select the nearest server. You can also manually choose other nodes.

## II. Proxy Generation & Testing

### 4. Test Connectivity (Optional)

Run in Command Prompt:

curl -x host:port -U "username:password" ipinfo.io

(Replace with your testing command)

### 5. Select Output Format

![Resi User Pass1](/images/resi-user-pass1.png)

Proxy information usually includes: Host, Port, Username, and Password.

### 6. Set the Number of Proxies

![Resi User Pass2](/images/resi-user-pass2.png)

Enter the number of IPs needed (e.g., 100) → Click 「Generate」.

### 7. Get Proxy List

After generation, copy individual proxies from 「Proxy List」, or export as TXT/CSV for bulk use.

<Warning>
  Security Recommendations: Never share proxy credentials; reset passwords periodically. Assign sub-user permissions judiciously.
