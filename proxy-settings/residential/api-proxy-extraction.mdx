B2Proxy offers a simple and user-friendly **API extraction method (authenticated via IP whitelisting)** to help users quickly obtain and use dynamic residential proxies. Even first-time users of proxy services can easily complete the configuration. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to add a whitelisted IP in the dashboard and successfully extract dynamic residential proxies via the API, helping you quickly master the entire workflow.

## I. Basic Setup Steps

### 1. Add IP Whitelist

![Resi Api](/images/resi-api.png)

Go to "IP Whitelist", click "Add Whitelist", and enter the IP address of the network environment where you need to use residential proxies.

<Warning>
  Note: API calls will be blocked for non-whitelisted IPs.
</Warning>

### 2. Select Proxy Location

Country/Region: Choose from dropdown (e.g., US).

### 3. Set the Number of Proxies

Enter required number of IPs (e.g., 100).

### 4. Protocol & Format Configuration

Protocol: Default HTTP(S), optional SOCKS5.

Format: Default TXT (one IP:PORT per line), optional JSON.

Separator: Default line break.

### 5. Set Session Type

Rotating IP: Auto-rotates IP per request (ideal for scraping/data collection).

Sticky IP: The IP remains fixed for a period of time (5 minutes by default), suits account management).

<Tip>
  When selecting a sticky IP, choose “Yes” in the [Change IP in Advance] option to allow the system to automatically switch the IP earlier based on its actual available time.\
  If you choose “No,” the IP will remain unchanged during the sticky session and can only be switched after the session ends.
</Tip>

### 6. Select Hostname

Automatically selects the nearest server based on your network IP, or you can manually choose other nodes.

### 7. Generate API URL

Click "Generate URL" to get a unique API URL.

## II. Call the API to Get Proxies

Open the API link in your browser or configure it in your tool. A correct response example would be:

1.1.1.1:8888

2.2.2.2:8888

…

If the following message appears, it means the whitelist was not added correctly. Please go back to step one and check.
