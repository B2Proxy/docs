B2Proxy's **Advanced Plans** offer higher traffic limits and flexible package options, making them ideal for high-frequency or large-scale proxy usage. They also support bulk discounts and non-expiring traffic. Combined with the **CDKey feature**, you can generate redemption codes containing specific traffic allowances to distribute to your team or customers. Once redeemed, the traffic is automatically credited to their accounts, offering a simple, secure, and efficient process.

## What is a CDKey?

A CDKey is a unique redemption code that can be used to:

- Allocate proxy resources (e.g., 100GB traffic)
